# Programming Tools for ROS 2

When working with ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), a well-configured development environment is crucial to facilitate efficient and productive work. This tutorial provides a detailed explanation of the tools used, their installation, configuration, and roles in a typical ROS 2 workflow. While these tools are not specific to ROS 2, they complement the development process, allowing you to streamline tasks such as code editing, terminal management, and build system configuration.

## 1. Terminal Multiplexer: Terminator

### What is Terminator?
Terminator is a terminal emulator that allows you to split a single terminal window into multiple panes. This feature is especially useful in ROS 2 development, where multiple terminal instances are often required simultaneously (e.g., running `ros2 launch`, visualizing data using `rviz2`, monitoring logs, etc.).

### Installation
To install Terminator on Ubuntu, open a terminal and run:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install terminator
```

### Launching Terminator
Once installed, launch Terminator by typing:
```bash
terminator
```

### Key Features
1. Terminal Splitting:
   - Horizontal Split: `Ctrl + Shift + O`
   - Vertical Split: `Ctrl + Shift + E`
   - Example Workflow:
     - Use one pane for `ros2 launch` commands.
     - Use another pane to monitor logs with `ros2 topic echo`.
     - Use additional panes for development tasks like running scripts or debugging.

2. Customization:
   - Right-click within the Terminator window and select `Preferences` to access various customization options (e.g., fonts, colors, and layouts).
   - Predefine layouts to save time during setup.

3. Keyboard Navigation:
   - Navigate between panes using `Ctrl + Tab`.

For detailed documentation, refer to [Terminator's official documentation](https://gnome-terminator.org/).

## 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code

### What is Visual Studio Code?
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight yet powerful source code editor. It supports extensions for various programming languages, build systems, and frameworks, making it an excellent choice for ROS 2 development.

### Installation
To install VS Code on Ubuntu, use the Snap package manager:
```bash
sudo snap install code --classic
```

### Launching VS Code
After installation, launch VS Code by typing:
```bash
code
```

### Essential Extensions for ROS 2
1. ROS Extension Pack:
   - Search for "ROS" in the Extensions Marketplace within VS Code.
   - Install the extension developed by Microsoft.
   - This extension automatically installs dependencies such as:
     - C/C++ for IntelliSense, debugging, and syntax highlighting.
     - Python for Python-based ROS 2 nodes.
     - Jupyter for interactive notebooks.

2. CMake Tools:
   - Search for "CMake" in the Extensions Marketplace.
   - Install the extension by `vector-of-bool` (not Microsoft).
   - This extension provides syntax highlighting and tooling support for `CMakeLists.txt`.

3. Additional Optional Extensions:
   - Python Linter: Ensure code adheres to PEP 8 standards.
   - GitLens: Enhance Git version control visualization.
   - Markdown Preview: Simplify README or documentation editing.

### Configuration Tips
1. ROS 2 Workspace Setup:
   - Use the ROS extension to set up a workspace. Open your ROS 2 workspace in VS Code and let the extension detect your environment.

2. Launch.json and Tasks.json:
   - Configure these files to automate build, test, and launch tasks for ROS 2 nodes.

3. Syntax Highlighting:
   - For `CMakeLists.txt`, enable syntax highlighting through the CMake extension.

4. Integrated Terminal:
   - Access the terminal directly within VS Code (`Ctrl + `` `), reducing the need to switch windows.
